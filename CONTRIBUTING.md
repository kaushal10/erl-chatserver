# Contributing to erl-chatserver


Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of
the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return,
they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing
patches and features.


## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/salman-bhai/erl-chatserver/issues) is
the preferred channel for spelling mistakes, errors or any general feedback. Please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and respect the opinions of others.

* Please **do not** open issues or pull requests that involve including **answers** to any of the questions.

## Pull requests

Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the
project's developers might not want to merge into the project.
